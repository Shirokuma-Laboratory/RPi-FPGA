# RPi-FPGA LMCXO2-100(Under Construction!)
Raspberry Pi I/O extention module using Lattice semiconductor MachXO2 FPGA/CPLD.

This PCB is desined for for 0.5mm pitch QFP 100pin package devices.  
Since 3.3v voltage is supplied from Raspberry Pi, the HC type devices that has 3.3v of the core voltage can be used.
