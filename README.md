# RPi-FPGA LMCXO2-100(Under Construction!)
Raspberry Pi I/O extention module using Lattice semiconductor MachXO2 FPGA/CPLD.

This PCB is desined for for 0.5mm pitch QFP 100pin package devices.
Since 3.3v voltage is supplied by the onboard LDO regulator circuit, the HC type devices that is 3.3v of core voltage can be used.
