# RPi-FPGA LMCXO2-100(Under Construction!)
Raspberry Pi I/O extention module using Lattice semiconductor MachXO2 FPGA/CPLD.

This PCB is desined for for 0.5mm pitch TQFP 100pin package devices of Lattice semiconductor MachXO2 FPGA/CPLDs.  
Since 3.3v voltage is supplied from Raspberry Pi, the HC type devices that has 3.3v of the core voltages can be used.
